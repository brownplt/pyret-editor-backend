This is completely derivative of Danny Yoo's repl-prototype, from
http://github.com/dyoo/whalesong.  I've repurposed it into a server for backing
a browser-based Pyret REPL.  All bugs are my fault and all praise for
engineering excellence belongs to Danny.

To use this, you need both Pyret and Whalesong installed and in your Racket
collections path.  If you check out Pyret (http://github.com/brownplt/pyret),
and run `make dep`, this will be done for you, with a Pyret-approved version of
Whalesong.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

1.

$ make pyret

This runs 'write-runtime.rkt', and points it to your installation of Pyret
(probably `raco link`ed).  This generates the runtime.js and library.js files
in htdocs/collects.

2.

$ make run

This starts server.rkt (listening on port 8080 to requests from localhost).

To expose the server to the world, use

$ make run-production

----------------------------------------------------------------------

TODO (maybe forever?): Try out the sandboxed server.
